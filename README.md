# Suicide-Cure

As words can be used for planting thoughts, your own feelings and thoughts can do the same.

So fight with positive constructive interests against the thought patterns, that make you eager for pain.
Try to understand what thoughts or feelings are heavy.
Try to get relief of the heavy mind by trying making rythms for what you feel.
Remember your rythms and try singing.
If you feel disturbed, then try listening to music, search for keywords for what you think could help or make you feel real.
Construct a pattern of where you make rythms while thinking heavy.
Get into reading manga or manwha, or watch anime.
There are many lists for different genres, try searching for keywords.
Let your fantasy guide you to relief.
